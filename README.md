üõçÔ∏è E-commerce Web Application
This repository holds the complete source code for a robust e-commerce web application, built with the power of Spring Boot. It's designed to offer a smooth shopping experience for customers and efficient management tools for businesses, handling everything from products and categories to users and orders.

‚ú® What It Does (Features)
Product Management: Easily add, view, update, and remove products. You can include all the essential details like name, description, price, stock levels, and images.

Category Organization: Keep your products neatly arranged with a hierarchical category system, making navigation a breeze for users.

Secure User Handling: We've built in secure user registration, login, and role-based access control, distinguishing between regular customers and administrators.

Persistent Shopping Cart: Customers can add items to their cart, and those selections stick around, even if they leave and come back later.

Streamlined Order Flow: Customers can place orders and review their history, while admins have the tools to manage order statuses efficiently.

Smart Search & Filtering: Finding products is simple with robust search capabilities and various filtering options.

Responsive Design: The interface looks great and works perfectly on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.

Dedicated Admin Dashboard: A special section gives administrators full control over the entire application.

üõ†Ô∏è Under the Hood (Technologies Used)
This project relies on a solid, modern tech stack chosen for its scalability, security, and ease of maintenance:

Backend:

Java 17+: The reliable foundation for our server-side logic.

Spring Boot: Our go-to framework for creating stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications quickly and efficiently.

Spring Data JPA: Makes working with database persistence and data access incredibly straightforward.

Spring Security: Handles all our authentication and authorization needs, keeping things secure.

Thymeleaf: A fantastic server-side template engine that helps us build dynamic web pages.

Database:

MySQL: A widely used and highly dependable relational database management system.

Frontend:

HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript: The standard trio for crafting engaging user interfaces.

Bootstrap (or similar CSS framework): Used to ensure a responsive and modern look and feel for the UI components.

Build Tool:

Maven: Manages our project's build process and all its dependencies, keeping everything organized.

üöÄ Let's Get It Running (Getting Started)
Ready to get this e-commerce app up and running on your local machine? Just follow these steps.

Prerequisites
Before you dive in, make sure you have these essentials installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher

Maven 3.6.x or higher

MySQL Server

Your favorite IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse STS)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-ecommerce-repo.git
cd your-ecommerce-repo

Set up your Database:

First, create a new MySQL database (something like ecommerce_db works well).

Next, you'll need to update the database connection details in src/main/resources/application.properties (or application.yml if you prefer):

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/ecommerce_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # Or 'create' for initial setup

A quick note: spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update will automatically create or update your database tables based on your Java entities. For production environments, you'll likely want to use a more robust migration tool like Flyway or Liquibase.

Build the Project:
Open your terminal, navigate to the project's root directory, and run:

mvn clean install

Running the Application
Once the project is built, you can fire up the application using Maven:

mvn spring-boot:run

Alternatively, if you're in your IDE, you can simply run the main class (it'll be named something like YourApplicationName.java).

The application should typically become accessible at http://localhost:8080.

üë®‚Äçüíª How to Use It
After the application is live:

Access the application: Just open your web browser and head over to http://localhost:8080.

Become a user: Go ahead and register for a new customer account to start exploring and shopping.

Admin Access: For the initial setup, you might need to create an admin user directly in your database. The course materials should guide you on how to set up that first administrator account.
